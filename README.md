Berry Unit Converter
====================
A unit converter is something handy to have on your PDA or smartphone. However,
I couldn’t find any free, useful unit converter for the Blackberry smartphone;
all I managed to find were J2ME generic converters that don’t blend in with the
Blackberry’s user interface and are in general a pain to use.

Thus, here is BerryUnitConverter; it is, indeed, a Blackberry Unit Converter.
All it does is convert between different units of measurement. It’s written
specifically for the Blackberry so it won’t work on generic J2ME phones; if you
need a converter for your J2ME phone, I suggest Abiro Unit Converter. Also, it
requires a Java-based model. It’s been tested on Pearl (81xx), Curve (8300) and
Storm (95xx) models but should work on the Bold as well.

BerryUnitConverter is free software, released under the GNU GPLv2.
